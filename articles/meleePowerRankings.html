    <p>With the end of the semester comes a new Rutgers Power Ranking! Things to keep in mind: this power ranking is a reflection of results of this period only, using the results from local Rutgers tourneys (the busch biweekly, Knight Slash, Fall Classic, etc) and nearby tournaments (8 on the break, JJs, Quarterly Rapport, etc). Three tournaments for the semester made a player eligible to be ranked.<br>
      Without further ado, here is the ranking. </p>
    <p><strong>1. Michael-Serpico “PudgyPanda” Vasta (Ice Climbers) - Junior</strong></p>
    <p>After getting Top 8 at Apex 2016, it’s no surprise to see Pudgy Panda at the number one spot. His approach-heavy style with Ice Climbers is very unique to the character. By rushing his opponents down, Pudgy Panda is often able to force a mistake out of even the most veteran of players, resulting in wins over the likes of C!Z and G$. It’ll only be a matter of time before Pudgy Panda is heralded in similar regard as Chu Dat and Wobbles for his creativity. </p>
    <p>Pudgy Panda will be the player to beat for Rutgers this spring. Anyone who is able to take him down will be considered serious contenders- he doesn’t drop sets to randoms. Luckily, Pudgy is the kind of player who will tell you exactly what he noticed you doing wrong and help you learn to beat him- though he won’t let it be easy!</p>
    <p><strong>2. Sam “Samjacobs1” Jacobs (Falco)- Junior </strong></p>
    <p>This year saw the departure of many strong Rutgers players such as Swedish Delight and Overflow, however Sam "Samjacobs1" Jacobs has remained a consistent powerhouse in the community. With his technical Falco, he's always looking to smother his opponents and set his own tempo. He has, without a doubt, the most international and tournament experience out of anybody at Rutgers.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, higher level classes and his job have hindered his ability to travel and compete at local tournaments. He's suffered some questionable losses this year and his rate of improvement slowed. With his rekindled desire to host tournaments at 6 Park, 2017 might finally be the year Samjacobs1 breaks the ceiling and becomes one of New Jersey's highest ranked players. </p>
    <p><strong>3. Mike “Clutch” Fabiunke (Marth)- Sophomore </strong></p>
    <p>By far, the breakout star of 2016 was Mike “Clutch” Fabiunke. His once-predictable Marth has developed a strong neutral game to balance out his already strong punish game. The same player who could never beat Samjacobs1 is now one of the few that can take him down. </p>
    <p>The latter half of the semester was slower for Clutch, as he was constantly bested by his rival Turtle. Dropping sets to Theftz and E-Tie were somber results to an otherwise stellar semester. Although he has to balance time in between practicing CS:GO, Melee, school, and relationships, let’s hope that he can clutch out a higher standard in Spring 2017.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Noah “Theftz” Gordon (Samus/Peach/JigglyPuff)- Senior </strong></p>
    <p>Noah attended fewer tournaments than usual this semester, however he definitely showed off his multi-character prowess. His original main is Samus, and although he is quite good with her, he often chooses to use Princess Peach or Jigglypuff. </p>
    <p>Having lived with the famous Swedish Delight, it is no surprise Theftz has consistently been a top 4 player at Rutgers, a threat at Rutgers tournaments since they began. The soon to be graduate has a unique methodical style, making very logical and textbook plays. He’s still known to go for risky, flashy plays once he’s built a lead, even with Jigglypuff. We hope to see more of the multi-main next semester.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Itai “Etai" Levi (Puff)- Freshmen</strong></p>
    <p>New kid on the block Itai “Etai” Levi is poised to take the Scarlet Smash by storm. Wielding a Puff and keeping a pocket Sheik, Etai has been able to take sets off of some of the most well established players in Rutgers. He started from netplay, and in one short year is the fifth best player at Rutgers.</p>
    <p>Despite his skill, his lack of tournament exposure causes him to be somewhat of a question mark. Perhaps he will plateau and perhaps he’ll keep improving. Either way, we’re all eager to see what Itai has in store in the upcoming year. </p>
    <p><strong>6. Kevin “Kmac” McGuire (Samus)-Sophomore</strong></p>
    <p>The younger half of the competitive McGuire brothers, Kevin “Kmac” McGuire hardly requires introduction. His Samus remains one of the strongest in the state, regardless of his inactivity. There’s no rust to be seen in his play; he could pick up a controller on any given day and still place top three.</p>
    <p>That being said, the times he does come out to tournaments are few and far between. The Melee Games team suffered a blow, as Kmac simply doesn’t show up anymore. Perhaps he’ll regain his passion in 2017, once he’s calmed down from the hectic college life. </p>
    <p><strong>7. Varun “YTG” Jain (Marth/Puff)- Junior</strong></p>
    <p>Although Varun has been one of the least active members of Scarlet Smash, he continues to display great proficiency for taking down well-practiced opponents. Any time he enters a tournament he represents a great threat to all competitors at Rutgers. However, his reluctance to improve his tech skill has perhaps kept him from beating some of the top players this year.</p>
    <p>Here’s hoping to YTG being able to enter more tournaments and reminding everyone of his efficient play-style. With house tournaments returning, perhaps the potential for prizes will make the time investment worth his while.</p>
    <p><strong>8. Johnny “Four” Sheffer (Fox)- Senior</strong> </p>
    <p>Johnny “Four” Sheffer is feast or famine incarnate in a Melee player. Either he’s hitting you with five up airs in a row and taunting or self destructing at spawn. There is no in between for Four, and it makes him absolutely exciting to watch. Either you tilt him or he will overwhelm you.</p>
    <p>We’ll see if the graduating veteran can exhibit consistency in his last semester as a Rutgers player. Although technical foxes are a dime a dozen, the community will certainly miss this loudmouth, and we hope to see him go out with a bang.</p>
    <p><strong>9. Arhum “WatchingTime” Siddiqi (Peach)- Junior</strong></p>
    <p>Arhum “WatchingTime” Siddiqi is one of the most valuable members of Scarlet Smash. From controller modifications to being one of the few pillars that constantly bring setups, Arhum’s presence has certainly made Scarlet Smash more interesting. There’s few people who love Melee as much as he does.</p>
    <p>He’s had a relatively quiet semester, as his status as a commuter makes it harder for him to attend certain Rutgers tournaments at night. With Theftz graduating this year, Arhum will have to step up and become the best Peach at Rutgers. Be sure to check out him and his keyboard controller next semester. </p>
    <p><strong>10. Karol “Krol” Wojcik (Fox)- Junior</strong></p>
    <p>One of the longest standing Scarlet Smashers, Karol “Krol” Wojcik is the last ranked player on this list. He’s a friendly monster, and recently has shown great drive in improving his game. His laidback approach to the game makes him one of the most pleasant people to be around, especially when tensions get high.</p>
    <p>This Fox/Captain Falcon main has been somewhat of a secret in the Rutgers community for years now. Through going to more and more tournaments, Karol will either break through and make a name for himself, or stay a hidden boss. </p>
    <p>Honorable Mentions: Garret "MainGChu" Chu, Kevin "SAT Prep" Wang, Varun "Soda" Sundar</p>
